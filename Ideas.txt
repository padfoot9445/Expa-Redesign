- force negates: -true == false; -false == false;
same for +
List<[string]>
! inverts: !true == false; !false == true; but also !-1 == 1; !1 == -1;(implicit comparison can be done with !(1) )

binary operations with structs and classes act on all fields, and only work on the same type or overloaded
